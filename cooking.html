            <p>Hello again! In this section, I will be talking about my cooking journey! 
                Well, technically some of the stuff below was baked, but... this side of the site is dedicated to the savoury side of food. 
                I will be talking a bit about adjusting to cooking for myself while also trying to stay healthy and on a budget. Enjoy!</p>

            <p id="top">Some Background<p>
            <p>Growing up, I never really cooked for myself. My mom is a great chef, so I was fortunate enough to have her make most of my meals for me. 
                Additionally, my dad loves to grill, so I always had that too. For 18 years of my life, I was surrounded by amazing food without even having to
                think about it. Going in to college, I then spent two years on a meal plan. Finally, this year, for the first time in my life, the food was in my hands.
                 Keep scrolling to learn more about some of the meals that have been keeping me afloat the past couple weeks.

        <div class = "container" id="ricecontainer">
                <p id = "rice">Rice! Rice! Rice!</p>
                <p class="rice_paragraph">I know, I know, I didn't invent rice. But, I do think it's underappreciated. Rice is a universal food. Throw it on 
                    the stove with some onions, veggies, and chicken, and you've got a quick and easy meal. Add soy sauce: it's fried rice! Add fajita seasoning: it's 
                     a burrito bowl! The opportunities are endless. Don't forget you can also add in some cauliflower rice if you're feeling ~healthy~ and eat double the serving 
                     half the calories. Moral of the story: don't underestimate the power of rice.

            <div class="bread_paragraph">
                <p>Obviously, I also didn't discover bread. But, just like rice, I think it deserves more hype than it gets. Especially my bread.
            I make great bread, not to brag. After years of baking, I got bored of making the same things over and over again. I love sweets, don't get me wrong,
             but I don't neccessarily need 3 dozen cookies on my counter every day. So, this summer, I switched to foods I would actually eat and use in my 
             daily life, like bread! Below are some of the loaves I've made, as well as the pretzels (and pretzel bagels) that my bread baking spiraled into!</p>

        <div class = "container">
            <p id= "pastaarticle">Pasta!</p>
            <p class="pasta_paragraph">Another obvious staple, yes, but have you ever tried homemade pasta? What about homemade pasta sauce? Making them from scratch 
                gives a much more flavorful dish without any harmful chemicals or unwanted additives, only what you choose to add! You can find one of my favorite 
                pasta recipes on the Recipes page, but I highly recommend doing your own research and searching for recipes to make your own version of your favorite 
                Italian dish. You will not be disappointed!<br><br>Another great way to change up your pasta is to switch up the noodles you use. I love Palmnini hearts 
                of palm noodles (they're much better than zoodles, don't worry) or spaghetti squash. Both substitutions are great ways to enjoy a huge bowl of pasta 
                without any guilt. And they actually taste good! Try it out!

        <div class = "container">
            <div id = "springrollcontainer">
                <p id = "springrolltitle">Spring Rolls!</p>
                <p class="springrolls">Spring rolls may seem complicated, but they are actually a great healthy and easy snack or meal. All you need is rice papers and 
                    the fillings of your choosing. I prefer boiling some rice noodles at the beginning of the week and chopping up carrots, cucumber, and bell peppers. 
                    When I am ready to eat, I add all of the pre-prepared fillings, along with some lettuce, avocado, and chicken (if I want more protein), and wrap them in the rice 
                    papers. They are delicious and make you feel like you are eating fast food! I love to pair it with a hoisin peanut butter dip (just a combo of the 
                    two). They balance each other perfectly! Spring rolls are also great for meal prep because I can make as many as I would like and keep them in the fridge 
                    for a grab and go snack. They may be daunting at first, but once you start, you won't regret it!
