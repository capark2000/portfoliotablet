            <h2>Baking</h2>
            <p>Hello again! In this section, I will be going more into the heart of it all: baking! 
                I know I have talked a lot about it in the intro, so hopefully my actual baking lives up to the hype. Below, I'll go through some of my past
                creations and tell you a little more about them! Enjoy!</p>

                    <p>Here are some examples of cakes I have made! Cakes are a classic and always the first thing people ask if I can make. 
                        I love making cakes because there is so much variety in what you can make. Above, you can see lots of different cakes I have baked 
                        and decorated in the past. In order left to right then top to bottom, there are cakes with a multitude of themes: Valentine's Day, 
                        smore's, Chantilly berry (my personal favorite), a classic birthday, chocolate covered strawberry, and double chocolate. I love 
                        trying out new things when it comes to cakes, but they honestly are very difficult, which can make them unreliable. Cakes are huge, so I 
                        must make sure I am completely committed to baking one when I begin. They also can be a big waste if you don't have somewhere to take it. 
                        Nowadays, I shy away from cakes unless it is specifically requested of me (like by a birthday girl) or I know for a fact there are people who 
                        want to (and actually will) eat the whole thing.

                    <p>Here are some examples of cookies I have made! Honestly, cookies are my favorite thing to bake. They are just so consistent. I have 
                        my sugar cookie routine down and love when I get the chance to use it. Cookies are also so versatile. You can make anything out of a cookie. 
                        An ugly Christmas sweater? Yes. Lacrosse jerseys? Yes. Champagne bottles? Of course. My schools letters? yes, yes, yes. The opportunities 
                        are endless.

                    <p>Here are some examples of other baked goods I have made! There are so many more things that you can bake than just cookies and cakes. 
                        A few things I enjoy to make are donuts, cupcakes, pies (and mini hand pies, because everything is better in mini version), macarons, and more! 
                        Every thanksgiving, I make mini hand pies for my family and family friends, and they are always a favorite. But, last year, COVID made our 
                        Thanksgiving different than normal. To keep as much normalcy as possible, I hand packaged each hand pie and sent them out to our friends. This 
                        was the perfect dessert because everyone could have their own individual dessert and prevent any spread of disease!
